Question 3:

//Function constructors

1.Case: fun sqrt(determiant: Double): Double{

            return determiant
        }

2.Case: fun sum(a:Int,b:Int):InT{
       return a+b
}
3.Case: class Car(var color:String,var model:string){}

    println(c)
    }
   
Output: Lana  Miera

Question 8:

Question 11:

Question 13:

Help use passes the message between activities:#
